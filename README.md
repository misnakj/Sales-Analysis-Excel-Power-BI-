**ONLINE RETAIL SALES DATA ANALYSIS**

**Introduction**
Welcome to the Online Retail Sales Data Analysis and Cleaning project. This project involves working with a dataset that contains records of an online retail store's sales transactions. The dataset is comprehensive, covering various aspects of sales such as invoice numbers, product descriptions, quantities sold, unit prices, customer information, and the countries from which the purchases were made.The dataset features a variety of products, primarily home decor and gift items.

**Dataset Overview**

InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction.

StockCode: Unique code assigned to each product.

Description: Detailed description of the products.

Quantity: Number of units sold per transaction.

InvoiceDate: Date and time when the transaction occurred.

UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product.

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Country: Country from which the customer made the purchase.



**Data Cleaning in Excel**

Initial data inspection.

Handling missing values.

Use the "remove duplicates" feature to remove duplicate rows.

Checking and correcting data types of each column.

Removing rows which has quantity value less than or equal to 0.

Removing rows which has unit price less than or equal to 0.

Created a new column for revenue (Revenue=quantity*unitprice)



**Data Analysis through data visualization**

After meticulously cleaning the dataset in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency, the next crucial step involves leveraging Power BI for comprehensive data analysis and visualization. Power BI enables the transformation of cleaned data into insightful, interactive visualizations that can uncover trends, patterns, and key metrics. By importing the cleaned dataset into Power BI, we can create dynamic dashboards featuring charts, graphs, and maps that provide a clear, visual representation of sales performance, customer demographics, and geographical sales distribution. These visual tools not only facilitate a deeper understanding of the data but also support informed decision-making and strategic planning by highlighting significant insights and anomalies.
